# Week 2 Lab Report - How To Use ieng6

[Back to main page](index.html)

## Step 1: Installing VS Code
1. Go to the [Visual Studio Homepage](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download Visual Studio Code to your computer.
2. Open VS Code and try creating a new file. Your screen should look like this:

## Step 2: Remotely Connecting
1. To connect to a remote server for your class, first open the terminal in VS code, click Terminal in the top bar and then click New Terminal. 

2. Type ssh + SPACE + the name of your course specific account so it looks like this: `` ssh *course-specific account*@ieng6.ucsd.edu `` in the terminal.

Example: ![Image](connecting_screenshot.png)

3. You should then be prompted for a password. If yours is not working go to the website [UCSD Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) (as shown in screenshot) and change the password for your course-specific account.

3. After you log in using your password in the terminal you should see an output like this:

## Step 3: Trying Some Commands
1. In the remote server, type `` ls ``. This will provide a list of files in that directory (folder). Folders in the list will be highlighted blue.
2. Now try opening a folder by typing `` cd *folder name* ``. Type the `` ls `` command again.
3. Notice no files show up. Now type `` ls -a ``.The command -a reveals the hidden files in the folder. Your terminal should look like this:

4. To exit the remote server, click CTRL + D or type `` exit `` and hit enter.

## Step 4: Moving Files with `` scp ``
1. In the terminal, write the command `` scp *filename* *account name*@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~./ ``, where the filename is an existing file on your computer.

2. Type in your password for your remote account. After you will get an output that looks like this:

3. Now, if you follow the `` ssh `` instrutions to log-in to your remote server, the file will appear in the main directory, and you can run it remotely using javac, java commands:

## Step 5: Setting an SSH Key
1. In your home directory terminal (not remote server), type `` ssh-keygen ``. Click ENTER once, then type a passphrase (something shorter than your password), then click ENTER again. Your terminal after typing the command should look like this:

![Image](key1.png)

2. Now copy the public key by typing the command `` scp /Users/liza_zakharova/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cs15lwi22acb@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys ``, but replace the username with your username and account with your course-specific account.

3. Now try logging in to your remote account. You should be prompted for your passphrase instead of a password:

## Step 6: Optimizing Remote Running
1. To optimize running, you can use the UP arrow key to find/copy previous commands you've written.

2. To make running more efficient, you can use semi-colons to separate commands in the same line, like in the example below:
